# DL-Iris-simple-classification-
I built a simple feedforward neural network using Keras with two hidden layers and ReLU activation, and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification. I scaled the input features, used categorical cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer, trained the model using backpropagation, and evaluated it on a test set to measure accuracy.
